    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large pot, heat the palm oil over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Add the chopped onion and minced garlic. Saut√© until the onion is translucent.</li>
        <li>Pour in the palm nut soup base and bring to a gentle boil.</li>
        <li>If using, add the smoked fish or meat to the boiling soup and let it simmer for about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Gradually add the roasted corn flour to the soup, stirring constantly to avoid lumps.</li>
        <li>Continue stirring as the mixture thickens. Add water as needed to achieve desired consistency.</li>
        <li>Season with salt and ground pepper to taste.</li>
        <li>Reduce heat to low and let the Apapransa simmer for about 15-20 minutes, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking.</li>
        <li>The final consistency should be thick and smooth, similar to a dense porridge.</li>
        <li>Remove from heat and let it cool slightly.</li>
        <li>Serve hot, often shaped into balls or mounds, alongside additional palm nut soup if desired.</li>
    </ol>
